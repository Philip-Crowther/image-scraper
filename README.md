# image-scraper
This code is a Python script that scrapes images from a specified URL and saves them to a local directory. It uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML of the provided URL and then traverses the page to find all images, including those embedded in links and other HTML elements. The script is run from the command line and takes two required arguments: the directory in which to save the images, and the URL from which to scrape them. The optional '-r' or '--recursive' flag can be added to enable recursive scraping of links within the same domain as the initial URL.

The script creates an ImageScraper object that handles most of the image scraping and file saving operations. When run, the ImageScraper makes an HTTP request to the provided URL, reads the HTML with BeautifulSoup, and searches for all images. If the '-r' flag is present, the ImageScraper will then traverse the page and find all links to other pages within the same domain, adding them to a stack of pages to visit. It will then visit each page in the stack, repeating the same scraping and link-finding process until there are no more pages left to visit.

For each page visited, the ImageScraper will create a subdirectory within the provided directory, named after the title of the page, in which to save the scraped images. It will then cycle through all images found on the page, retrieving them from their source URLs and saving them to the subdirectory with numbered filenames. If an image is embedded within an HTML element, the script will attempt to extract the image source from the element's attributes. If a provided URL is a relative link, the script will build an absolute link from the initial URL. The ImageScraper also includes several error-handling mechanisms to handle missing image sources, invalid links, and pages that cannot be reached.
